## Communication

We use **Discord** as our main communication hub to share updates, brainstorm, and collaborate in real time. Most conversations happen in public channels to keep everyone informed and aligned across different teams.

Technology is at the core of how we work—both in expanding access to mental health services and enabling transparent, agile collaboration.
